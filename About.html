        <p id="p1-index">Rivera Roasts was born from a love of community, 
            craftsmanship, and, of course, coffee. What started as a small 
            dream in a home kitchen has grown into a welcoming neighborhood 
            café where quality and connection come first. We believe every 
            cup tells a story — from the farmers who grow our beans with 
            care, to the baristas who pour their heart into every shot.
             At Rivera Roasts, we source only ethically grown, small-batch
              beans, roasted to perfection to bring out bold, complex flavors.
               Whether you're a morning regular grabbing your daily espresso
                or a traveler discovering us for the first time, we aim to make
                 your experience warm, memorable, and delicious. Our space is
                  designed for gathering — a cozy corner for quiet moments
                   or a lively hub to meet friends. From our hand-crafted 
                   drinks to our homemade pastries, everything we do is rooted 
                   in passion and purpose. Welcome to Rivera Roasts — where the 
                   coffee is strong, the people are kind, and you're always 
                   part of the family.</p>

        <h2 id="h2-about">Meet the Team</h2>
        <h4 id="ah4">Maria Rivera – Founder & Head Roaster</h4>
        <p id="a1">
            Maria started Rivera Roasts with nothing but a dream, 
            a vintage espresso machine, and a deep respect for the 
            craft of coffee. She sources every bean with care and 
            roasts in-house to bring out unique, rich flavors in every blend.

        <h4 id="ah4">Jamal Harris – Lead Barista</h4>
        <p id="a1">
            With a background in latte art competitions and a playlist 
            for every shift, Jamal brings energy and expertise to every 
            pour. He’s the face you’ll see at the counter most mornings — 
            just ask for his signature cinnamon mocha.
        </p>

        <h4 id="ah4">Lena Tran – Baker & Vibes Manager</h4>
        <p id="a1">
            Lena’s pastries are the reason many customers return daily. 
            From flaky croissants to vegan chocolate muffins, she keeps our 
            menu fresh and seasonal. She's also the one behind the cozy decor 
            and Sunday playlist.
        </p>

        <h4 id="ah4">Tyler Nguyen – Marketing & Social Media</h4>
        <p id="a1">
            If you've seen our Insta reels or caught wind of our monthly 
            coffee tastings, that's Tyler’s work. He keeps the world 
            connected to our shop and is always coming up with clever new 
            promos (ask him about the “Roast & Relax” punch card).
